For ARP
Run the filter arp.opcode == 1 to show only the ARP requests.
Run the filter arp.opcode == 2 to show only the ARP responses.


The filters are based on the flag field set in the TCP header. For example:
    To view only SYN requests with the SYN flag set to 1 and the ACK flag set to 0, run:
        tcp.flags.syn ==1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0
    To view only SYN/ACK responses with the SYN flag set to 1 and the ACK flag also set to 1, run:
        tcp.flags.syn ==1 && tcp.flags.ack == 1
    To view only ACK responses with the ACK flag set to 1 and the SYN flag set to 0, run:
        tcp.flags.syn == 0 && tcp.flags.ack == 1


To view TCP termination packets with the FIN flag set to 1, run:
tcp.flags.fin == 1


Wireshark can also easily distinguish between the client and server in these TCP handshakes:
Remove all filters. The client IP is 10.0.2.15 and the server IP 93.184.216.34.
    In the SYN request, the client IP is the source and the server IP is the destination.
    In the SYN/ACK response, the client IP is the destination and the server IP is the source.
    In the ACK response, the client IP is the source and the server IP is the destination.
    To see the domain of the web server being accessed, you can select:
        View > Name Resolution > Resolve Network Address
    After this has been selected, the website being accessed is clearly shown as example.com.
