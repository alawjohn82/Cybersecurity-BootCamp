Activity File: Network Addressing
In this activity, you will continue to play the role of a security analyst at Acme Corp.
Your security manager identifies the potential hacker that works at Acme Corp. Your manager is also capturing the potential hacker's traffic. They believe the hacker is accessing secret internal resources.
While your security manager is able to capture the server IP address the hacker is accessing, they are only able to capture the raw binary traffic.
Your task is to convert the binary traffic into an IP address, determine if it is a public or private address, and compare the IP to a list of Acme's servers to see which system the hacker is attempting to access.

Instructions
Convert the following binary representations into numeric IP addresses:
11000000101010000100010110010001
00001010000000000000000000101010
11000000101011000100010110010001
00101001001011011011011000100000
00001010000000000000000001001100
Determine whether the numeric IP addresses are public or private.
Compare the numeric IP addresses to the Acme server list and determine to which server the IPs belong.
Summarize your findings to determine what resources the hacker is trying to access.
Bonus
Your security manager also finds the following binary data in the hacker's logs:
100010001111011111000111011001010001101000110110
Determine what this binary data represents.
Hint: This may translate to an IP address, but it is not actually an IP address.


Solution Guide: Network Addressing
To complete this activity, you had to:
Convert binary traffic into IP addresses.
Determine if they are public or private addresses.
Compare the IPs to a list of Acme's servers to see which systems the hacker is attempting to access.

IP Address 1:
Use the Browserling web tool to convert the numeric IP representation of 11000000101010000100010110010001 to 192.168.69.145.
This is a private IP address and falls in the network range of Acme Trade Secrets.
IP Address 2:
The numeric IP representation of 00001010000000000000000000101010 is 10.0.0.42.
This is a private IP address and falls in the network range of Acme Trade Secrets.
IP Address 3:
The numeric IP representation of 11000000101011000100010110010001 is 192.172.69.145.
This is a public IP address and falls in the network range of Acme Trade Secrets.
IP Address 4:
The numeric IP representation of 00101001001011011011011000100000 is 41.45.182.32.
This is a public IP address and falls in the network range of Acme Intellectual Property Secrets.
IP Address 5:
The numeric IP representation of 00001010000000000000000001001100 is 10.0.0.76.
This is a private IP address and falls in the network range of Acme Trade Secrets.
Final Summary
Based on the findings, the hacker is primarily trying to access Acme Corp's trade secrets and a server containing intellectual property data.
Bonus
The binary data of 100010001111011111000111011001010001101000110110 is actually a binary representation of a physical MAC address.
This is likely the MAC address of the machine the hacker is trying to access or even the machine belonging to the hacker.
MAC addresses are displayed in hex, so this needs to be converted with a binary to hex converter, such as the following: Rapid Tables binary to hex converter.
When converted, the hex representation is 88F7C7651A36 or 88:F7:C7:65:1A:36.
