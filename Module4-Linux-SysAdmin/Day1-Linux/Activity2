Activity File: Installing Packages
Now that we have stopped a malicious service from running and completed a basic audit, we're going to cover some of the miscellaneous utilities that we can install onto our VMs. Specifically, we'll install the following services:
emacs is a traditional file editor.
cowsay is a utility that takes in input and displays a cow repeating it.
Instructions
Many of these files will install in the /usr/games directory, which is not part of the $PATH variable
Run  echo "export PATH='/usr/games:$PATH'" >> .bashrc && source .bashrc to update the $PATH variable.
To install the packages emacs and cowsay, you will need to use the command that you have learned from the Installing Packages lecture.
Each time you install a package, apt will ask for permission to use the disk space needed to install the package.
Use the man pages to find a flag that lets you automatically answer yes to any prompts that come up when installing a package.
Install the remaining packages by using this command.
Next we will want to use our new packages. Use the following commands to run your new utilities:
emacs will open your new text editor.
cowsay hello will start a new line with a cow saying "hello."
Bonus
Find the command that will let you install multiple packages with a single command.
Run the following command:
cowsay "Linux is Fun!"

Solution Guide: Installing Packages
To install the packages emacs and cowsay, we need to use the command apt with the following syntax:
sudo apt install <package>
emacs is a traditional file editor.
cowsay is a utility that takes in input and displays a cow repeating it.
Instructions
Update the $PATH
Run  echo "export PATH='/usr/games:$PATH'" >> .bashrc && source .bashrc to update the $PATH variable
Each time you install a package, apt will ask for permission to acquire the disk space needed to install the package.
Use the man pages to find the flag that lets you automatically answer yes to any prompts that come up when installing a package:
Run man apt.
The flag is sudo apt -y install <package name>.
To install the remaining package, run the following commands:
sudo apt -y install cowsay
Next we will want to use our new packages. Use the following commands to run your new utilities:
emacs will open your new text editor.
cowsay hello will start a new line with a cow saying "hello."
Bonus
Is there a way to install multiple packages with a single command?
Yes. Include each package name in the command, separated by a space:
sudo apt -y install emacs cowsay
Run the following command:
cowsay "Linux is Fun!"
