Activity File: Process Investigation
In the last activity, we completed a basic audit of the system and found some malicious script files and a user that was not supposed to be on the system. Now we will investigate all the processes running on the system to check if there are any obvious processes that should not be running.
Your senior administrator has asked that you record snapshots of processes, as well as review the processes in real time for anything suspicious.
You must review the processes that are running on the system to make sure nothing is amiss. If it is, you will want to kill that process and add what you found to your report.
Instructions
Log into the lab environment with the following credentials:
Username: sysadmin
Password: cybersecurity

To get started with your activity, run the following command in your terminal:
sudo bash /home/instructor/Documents/setup_scripts/instructor/processes.sh </dev/null &>/dev/null

After this, you'll be able to use your terminal like usual.

Please read the following instructions and complete the steps.

During the last activity, you found a script file in a strange location on the system. Review the contents of this script file to get an idea of what commands you might be searching for.
List all the running processes in real time.
Review the help menu for this command and get a few ideas of what you want to investigate.
Highlight the column that you are sorting by.
To get an idea of how the system is currently running, answer these questions:
How many tasks have been started on the host?
How many of these are sleeping?
Which process uses the most memory?
Search all running processes for a specific user.
Review all the processes started by the root or sysadmin user.
Sort by other users on the system that may be of interest.
Hint: In the previous exercise, you found a home folder for a user who should not be on this system. Is that user running processes?

Bonus

Next, take a static "snapshot" of all currently running processes and save it to a file in your home directory with the name currently_running_processes.
Use the flag to list all processes that have a TTY terminal.
In the short list of output, do you notice any processes that seem suspicious?
Identify the ID of any suspicious process. Stop that process with the kill command.
Kill all processes launched by the user who started the command you just stopped.
Use Google and the man pages to identify a command with the appropriate flag that will let you stop all processes owned by a specific user.


Solution Guide: Process Investigation
The goal of this activity was to identify resource-draining services affecting our system. More specifically, this activity required the following steps:
Use top to monitor for suspicious processes.
Use ps to check what processes are running.
Identify a suspicious process.
Research signal flags used with the kill command.
Use the appropriate kill signal to stop the suspicious process.

During the last activity, you found a script file in a strange location on the system. Review the contents of this script file to get an idea of what commands you might be searching for.
List all the running processes in real time.
Solution: top
Review the help menu for this command and get a few ideas of what you want to investigate.
Solution: man top
Highlight the column that you are sorting by.
Solution: You can enable column highlighting and sorting by pressing the x key. By default, the %CPU column is highlighted and sorted by highest CPU usage.
To get an idea of how the system is currently running, answer these questions:
Note: Answers will vary by machine. We'll use the following example image to answer these questions.
How many tasks have been started on the host?
Solution: 250
How many of these are sleeping?
Solution: 0
Which process uses the most memory?
Solution: gnome-shell


Search all running processes for a specific user.
Review all the processes started by the root or sysadmin user.
Solution type: u followed by the name of the user.
Sort by other users on the system that may be of interest.
Hint: In the previous exercise, you found a home folder for a user who should not be on this system. Is that user running processes?
Solution: Jack is running the stress-ng processes



Bonus
Next, take a static "snapshot" of all currently running processes, and save it to a file in your home directory with the name currently_running_processes.
Use the flag to list all processes that have a TTY terminal.
Solution: ps aux >> ~/currently_running_processes
In the short list of output, do you notice any processes that appear suspicious?
Solution: Yes, Jack is running a process stress0ng --matrix 0 --times. These commands intentionally stress the system and consume resources, which could result in a denial of service from the server.

Identify the ID of any suspicious process. Stop that process with the kill command.
Solution: Run kill <PID number> or kill 4714 4715.
Kill all processes launched by the user who started the command you just stopped.
Use Google and the man pages to identify a command with the appropriate flag that will let you stop all processes owned by a specific user.
Solution: sudo killall -u jack.
