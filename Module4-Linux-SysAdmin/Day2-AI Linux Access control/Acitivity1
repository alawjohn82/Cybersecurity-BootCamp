Activity File: Let's Talk to John
In this activity, your senior administrator has asked you to audit the strength of users' passwords by using the john program and document any passwords that you find.
To complete these tasks, you will use the program john the ripper on the password file you viewed from Day 1. You will use john to crack the passwords for several users on the system.
Instructions
Make a copy of the /etc/shadow file in your /home/sysadmin directory. Name the copy: "shadow_copy".
Note: Don't forget to use sudo!
Use nano to edit your "shadow_copy" file to leave only the rows for the following users to crack:
Jack, Adam, Billy, Sally, Max
Run sudo john shadow_copy.
Note: This command is all you need to crack passwords.
This will take some time, but let John the Ripper run, and take note of any passwords you find.



Solution Guide: Let's Talk to John
In this activity, you used the program john the ripper to crack the passwords for several users on the system.
Solutions
Make a copy of the /etc/shadow file in your /home/sysadmin directory. Name the copy: "shadow_copy".
cd /home/sysadmin
sudo cp /etc/shadow shadow_copy
Use Nano to edit your "shadow_copy" file to leave only the rows for the following users you will crack: Jack, Adam, Billy, Sally, Max.
Run sudo nano shadow_copy and delete all extra lines that are not the above users.
Note: ctrl-k will delete the current line in Nano.
Your edited file should be similar to this:
max:$6$WhPNYTYJx2jx25x$QWy.....     
billy:$6$Q.zRCddM9cwb5YUJh......
jack:$6$ilIqVoXkja6GG8PK$t....
Run sudo john shadow_copy.
This will take some time, but let John the Ripper run, and take note of any passwords you find.
You should be able to crack the following passwords fairly quickly:
jack : lakers
adam : welcome
billy: football
sally : 123456
max : welcome
Note: Since we use sudo cp /etc/shadow shadow_copy, shadow_copy will be owned by root and have the same permissions as the original.
Therefore, we have to use sudo nano and sudo john. Alternatively, we could have changed the ownership of shadow_copy with sudo chown sysadmin:sysadmin shadow_copy, and then not have to use sudo for nano or john.
