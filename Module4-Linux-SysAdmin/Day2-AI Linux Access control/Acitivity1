Activity File: Let's Talk to John
In this activity, your senior administrator has asked you to audit the strength of users' passwords by using the john program and document any passwords that you find.
To complete these tasks, you will use the program john the ripper on the password file you viewed from Day 1. You will use john to crack the passwords for several users on the system.
Instructions
Make a copy of the /etc/shadow file in your /home/sysadmin directory. Name the copy: "shadow_copy".
Note: Don't forget to use sudo!
Use nano to edit your "shadow_copy" file to leave only the rows for the following users to crack:
Jack, Adam, Billy, Sally, Max
Run sudo john shadow_copy.
Note: This command is all you need to crack passwords.
This will take some time, but let John the Ripper run, and take note of any passwords you find.
