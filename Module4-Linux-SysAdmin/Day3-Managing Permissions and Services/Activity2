Activity File: Managing Services
In this activity, you will continue with an audit of the services running on the server.
Your senior administrator wants you to audit the services and shut down insecure and/or unused services. They have provided a list of services to check.
You will check for these services and shut down and remove any that you find running on the server.
Instructions
Your senior administrator provided the following notes:
Some of our systems may have old services running that are no longer used. Because services can be exploited, we want to run as few of them as possible. The services we should check for are the following:
File Transfer Protocol (FTP): This file-sharing service is outdated, insecure, and easily exploitable. Cybercriminals often use it to upload malicious files, so we need it removed immediately.
Telnet: We used to use Telnet to get a shell on this server from a remote computer. This allowed us to easily reconfigure the server while not being in the office. Unfortunately, Telnet is notoriously insecure and easily hacked. Remove it so no one can log in to this machine remotely.
HTTP: HTTP is used to send files over the internet and host websites. This server is not supposed to be hosting websites, so stop and remove this service.
Bonus—IMAP and/or POP3: These services are used to send and receive emails. This server should not be managing emails, so stop and remove these services.
Bonus—Network Information Service: This is an old service that provides information about the entire network. Attackers often use this to gather information about this server and other machines on the network, which they can use to break in more easily. Stop and remove this service to prevent attackers from doing so.
To check for the above services, make sure none of these is running:
vsftpd.service (FTP)
apache2.service (HTTP)
nginx.service (HTTP)
Bonus: xinetd.service (Telnet)
Bonus: dovecot.service (IMAP or POP3)
For any listed services that you find on the system, complete the following:
Stop the service.
Verify that the service is stopped.
Disable the service. (:warning: Do not disable apache2 or nginx. They will be needed for a later activity.)
Remove the service from the system. (Take note of the commands to remove these services, but do not actually remove them. We will use them again for the next activity.)
Hint: Dovecot comes in two packages: dovecot-imapd and dovecot-pop3d. You'll need to remove both to successfully uninstall this service.



Solution Guide: Managing Services 
 
This activity was an audit of the services running on this server. To complete this activity, you 
need to: 
• Identify the services in the list that are installed and running on the machine; 
• Stop each service; 
• Disable each service; and 
• Uninstall each service. 
Run systemctl -t service --all to determine which services are running. The following services 
from the list are listed as present on the server: 
• vsftpd.service (FTP) 
• apache2.service (HTTP) 
• nginx.service (HTTP) 
Bonus 
• xinetd.service (Telnet) 
• dovecot.service (IMAP or POP3) 
These services can help attackers gain access to the server, and none of them are necessary 
for the server to function properly. 
• To stop a service: 
o Run sudo systemctl stop <service_name>. 
• To verify the service is stopped: 
• Run systemctl status <service_name>. 
o Note: You can run systemctl against multiple services like this: systemctl status 
<service_name_1> <service_name_2>. You can start, stop, enable, and disable 
multiple services at once too. 
• To disable the service: 
• Run sudo systemctl disable <service_name>. 
o Note: Do not actually disable nginx or apache2 from the system because they 
are needed later. 
• To remove the service from the system: 
• Run sudo apt remove <service_name>. 
o Note: Do not actually remove nginx or apache2 from the system because they 
are needed later.
