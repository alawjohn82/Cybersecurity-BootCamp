Activity File: Simple Cronjobs
In this activity, you are a junior administrator at Rezifp Pharma Inc.
In response to the ransomware attacks, you are responsible for using cron to automate backup jobs for the E-Prescription Treatment database.
The company maintains a large number of files associated with patients, doctors, and their treatments. Administrators at various clinics often create files that contain the .txt file extension—e.g., patients12987.txt, and store them in their user downloads folders.
The E-Prescription Treatment database data is used by several departments at Rezifp Pharma Inc. and contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as email addresses, passwords, and biometric records.
Your work will ensure the integrity and availability of the data and help ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations required by all medical institutions that collect and store patient health information.
You have been tasked to:
Create /doctors, /patients, and /treatments directories under /usr/share.
Automate a cronjob that organizes the files created by administrators by moving them from the users' ~/Downloads directories into the /usr/share/doctors, /usr/share/patients, and /usr/share/treatments directories, where they can be read by all users.
Automate daily full backups of the directories and files in the /usr/share directory.
Automate daily full backups of the user's ~/Downloads directory into the /usr/share directory.
Verify the archive after it is written to check for errors.
Instructions
Start by verifying that the cron service is running.
Inspect your user crontab to ensure no one has tampered with it.
Observe that there are no uncommented lines present in the crontab.
Now that you're sure cron is up and running, schedule some jobs to periodically clean up the sysadmin user's home folder.
Specifically, these jobs will move files out of ~/Downloads and sort them into the appropriate directory for their file type. To schedule them, create the following directories:
/usr/share/doctors
/usr/share/patients
/usr/share/treatments
Bonus: Create all three directories with a single command. (Hint: Use brace expansion.)
Open your crontab for editing, and schedule the following jobs to run at the specified time intervals:
Every day at 6pm, move all doctors*.docx files in ~/Downloads to /usr/share/doctors.
Every day at 6pm, move all patients*.txt files in ~/Downloads to /usr/share/patients.
Every day at 6pm, move all treatments*.pdf files in ~/Downloads to /usr/share/treatments.
Close and save your crontab files before moving on.
Double-check that your crontab has been created in /var/spool/cron. Remember the path to your crontab file once you find it.
Bonus
Create the following cronjobs:
Every Friday at 11pm, create a compressed tarball of all files in ~/research in ~/Documents/MedicalArchive. Name the archive Medical_backup.tar.gz.
Every Friday at 11:05pm, verify the validity of the archive Medical_backup.tar.gz.
Every day at 4am, create a list of all files in ~/Downloads. Save it to ~/Documents/Medical_files_list.txt.
Close and save your crontab files before moving on.
Double-check that your crontab has been created in /var/spool/cron. Remember the path to your crontab file once you find it.


Solution Guide: Simple Cronjobs
Completing this activity required the following steps:
Using systemctl to verify that the cron daemon is installed and running.
Using crontab –l to inspect user crontab and verify its validity.
Using crontab -e to edit user crontab files.
Using crontab to automate cronjobs to move and archive files and directories.
Verifying archives after they are written to check for errors.
Solutions
Start by verifying that the cron service is running.
Run systemctl status cron
Inspect your user crontab to ensure no one has tampered with it.
Observe that there are no uncommented lines present in the crontab.
Run crontab -l
Now that you're sure cron is up and running, you'll schedule some jobs to periodically clean up the sysadmin user's home folder. Specifically, these jobs will move files out of ~/Downloads and sort them into the appropriate directory for their file types. In order to schedule them, you'll need to create the following directories:
/usr/share/doctors
/usr/share/patients
/usr/share/treatments
Run the following command:
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/doctors
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/patients
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/treatments
Add group permissions:
sudo chown root:sysadmin /usr/share/doctors
sudo chown root:sysadmin /usr/share/patients
sudo chown root:sysadmin /usr/share/treatments
Bonus: Create all three directories with a single command. (Hint: Use brace expansion.)
Run sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/{doctors,patients,treatments}.
Open your crontab for editing, and schedule the following jobs to run at the specified time intervals:
Every day at 6pm, move all doctors*.docx files in ~/Downloads to /usr/share/doctors.
Every day at 6pm, move all patients*.txt files in ~/Downloads to /usr/share/patients.
Every day at 6pm, move all treatments*.pdf files in ~/Downloads to /usr/share/treatments.
Run crontab -e.
After opening the crontab file, scroll to the bottom and add the following lines:
0 18 * * * mv ~/Downloads/doctors*.docx /usr/share/doctors
This command will schedule and move all doctors*.docx files in ~/Downloads to /usr/share/doctors every day at 6pm.
0 18 * * * mv ~/Downloads/patients*.txt /usr/share/patients
This command will schedule and move all patients*.txt files in ~/Downloads to /usr/share/patients.
0 18 * * * mv ~/Downloads/treatments*.pdf /usr/share/treatments
Make sure to close and save your crontab files before moving on.
After scheduling your jobs, double-check that your crontab has been created in /var/spool/cron. Remember the path to your crontab file once you find it.
Run sudo ls -l /var/spool/cron/crontabs | grep sysadmin.
Bonus
Create the following additional cronjobs.
Every Friday at 11pm, create a compressed tarball of all files in ~/research in ~/Documents/MedicalArchive. Name the archive Medical_backup.tar.gz.
0 23 * * 5 tar czvf ~/Documents/MedicalArchive/Medical_backup.tar.gz ~/research
Every Friday at 11:05pm, verify the validity of the archive Medical_backup.tar.gz.
5 23 * * 5 gzip -t Medical_backup.tar.gz >> /usr/share/backup_validation.txt
This command will perform a long listing of the ~/Downloads directory daily at 4am. It will then send the output to the ~/Documents/Medical_files_list.txt.
0 4 * * * ls -l ~/Downloads > ~/Documents/Medical_files_list.txt
After scheduling your jobs, double-check that your crontab has been created in /var/spool/cron. Remember the path to your crontab file once you find it.
sudo ls -l /var/spool/cron/crontabs | grep sysadmin
