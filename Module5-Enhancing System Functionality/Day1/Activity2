Activity File: Restoring Data with Incremental Backups
In this activity, you will continue as a junior administrator at Rezifp Pharma Inc, which has just adopted a new backup policy.
You will be responsible for validating the new backup process by performing the following two tests:
Use a backup to restore lost patient files.
Create two new files and perform an incremental backup.
You will use the following process to test the new restoration procedure:
List and verify the existing files in the testenvir directory.
Create a level 0 backup on Sunday containing the entire testenvir directory.
Simulate a cyberattack by deleting the patient directory from the testenvir parent folder.
Verify the patient directory is missing.
Restore the missing patient directory from the incremental backup.
List and verify the patient directory to verify the restoration was successful.
Create two new files in the patient directory.
Create an incremental backup on Monday and verify that the new patient files have been properly backed up.
Finally, your team will conclude this exercise by reviewing file attributes as a result of the backup process.
Lab Environment
If you are not already logged on, log into this moduleâ€™s lab environment using the following credentials:
Username: sysadmin
Password: cybersecurity
Instructions
Move into the ~/Documents/epscript/testenvir directory and list the contents.
In your ~/Documents/epscript directory, create the level 0 backup of the testenvir directory, which contains the doctor, patient, and treatment directories.
Change back into the epscript directory:
Run cd ../
Create the level 0 backup of the testenvir directory.
View and verify the contents of the level 0 backup by using tar.
What is the status of the files in the backup?
What does D indicate?
What does Y indicate?
Next, we'll simulate a natural disaster or cyberattack by removing the patient directory.
From the ~/Documents/epscript directory:
Run rm -r testenvir/patient/.
Verify that the patient directory is removed.
Run ls -l testenvir/.
Your output should look similar to the following. Notice that the patient directory is missing:

total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Jul 14 10:14 doctor
drwxr-xr-x 3 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Jul 14 10:14 treatment
Restore the missing patient directory from the epscript_back_sun.tar backup to the ~/Documents/epscript/testenvir/patient/ directory.
Make sure you're in the epscript directory:
Run cd ~/Documents/epscript.
Restore the missing patient directory.
Verify that the files have been added to the testenvir/patient directory successfully.
Run ls -l testenvir/.
If successful, the missing patient directory should be properly restored from the archive.
Before we create an incremental backup, we'll add new files. Let's add a couple of files to the patient directory:
First, ensure you're in the cd ~/Documents/epscript/testenvir/patient/ directory.
Run cd ~/Documents/epscript/testenvir/patient/.
Create a few arbitrary files:
For example: touch patient.0a.txt patient.0b.txt.
Verify the files have been created
Run ls -l.
Output should look similar to the following. Notice the two new files patient.0a.txt and patient.0b.txt have been successfully created:

total 284
-rw-r--r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin      0 Aug 13 12:27 patient.0a.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin      0 Aug 13 12:27 patient.0b.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin   6236 Jul 14 10:14 patients.10.csv
-rw-r--r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin   6250 Jul 14 10:14 patients.11.csv
Assume it's Monday. Now, we'll create an incremental backup that will include our newly created patient documents.
Change back to the ~/Documents/epscript directory:
Run cd ~/Documents/epscript.
Create an incremental backup for Monday.
List the contents of the epscript_back_mon.tar incremental backup and verify that the new files have been archived.
What is the status of the files in the incremental backup?
For additional reference, consider the following:
Manpages: backup-manager

Solution Guide: Restoring Data with Incremental Backups
Incremental Backup Restoration
Move into the ~/Documents/epscript/testenvir directory and list the contents.
Run cd ~/Documents/epscript/testenvir.
Run ls -l.
Notice the doctor, patient, and treatment directories.

total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Jul 14 10:14 doctor
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Jul 14 10:14 patient
drwxr-xr-x 3 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Jul 14 10:14 treatment
In your ~/Documents/epscript directory, create the level 0 backup of the testenvir directory, which contains the doctor, patient, and treatment directories.
Move back into the epscript directory:
Run cd ../.
Create the level 0 backup of the testenvir directory by running:
Run tar cvvWf epscript_back_sun.tar --listed-incremental=epscript_backup.snar --level=0 testenvir.
Your very verbose output should look similar to the following:

tar: testenvir: Directory is new
tar: testenvir/doctor: Directory is new
tar: testenvir/patient: Directory is new
tar: testenvir/treatment: Directory is new
tar: testenvir/treatment/backup: Directory is new

Restore the missing patient directory from the epscript_back_sun.tar backup to the ~/Documents/epscript/testenvir/patient/ directory.
Make sure you're in the epscript directory:
Run cd ~/Documents/epscript.
Restore the missing patient directory:
Run tar xvvf epscript_back_sun.tar -R -C ~/Documents/epscript/ testenvir/patient/.
Your very verbose output should look similar to the following:

drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Jul 14 10:14 patient
drwxr-xr-x 3 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Jul 14 10:14 treatment
The missing patient directory has been properly restored from the archive.
Before we create an incremental backup, we'll create some files in the patient directory:
Make sure you're in the cd ~/Documents/epscript/testenvir/patient/ directory.
Run cd ~/Documents/epscript/testenvir/patient/.
Create a couple of arbitrary files:
Run touch patient.0a.txt patient.0b.txt.
Verify that the files have been added:
Run ls -l.
Output should look similar to the following. Notice the two new files patient.0a.txt and patient.0b.txt have been successfully created:

total 284
-rw-r--r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin      0 Aug 13 12:27 patient.0a.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin      0 Aug 13 12:27 patient.0b.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin   6236 Jul 14 10:14 patients.10.csv
-rw-r--r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin   6250 Jul 14 10:14 patients.11.csv
Assume it's Monday. Now, we'll create an incremental backup that will include our newly created patient documents as follows:
Change back to the ~/Documents/epscript directory:
Run cd ~/Documents/epscript.
Create an incremental backup for Monday as follows:
Run tar cvvWf epscript_back_mon.tar --listed-incremental=epscript_backup.snar testenvir.
List the contents of the epscript_back_mon.tar incremental backup and verify that the new files have been archived.
Run tar tvvf epscript_back_mon.tar --incremental | less.
Your output should look similar to the following. Notice that our new patient files patient.0a.txt and patient.0b.txt have been successfully archived under the testenvir/patient/ directory:

drwxr-xr-x sysadmin/sysadmin 29 2020-08-13 12:05 testenvir/

What is the status of the files in the incremental backup?
D indicates directories.
N indicates that the file was present in the directory at the time the archive was made. However, it was not added to the epscript_back_mon.tar archive because it had not changed since the last backup.
Y indicates that the file is contained in the epscript_back_mon.tar archive.
Bonus Review Questions
What is the difference between a full and incremental backup?
A full backup saves every file on a hard drive.
An incremental backup only saves the data that has changed since the last full backup.
If you have a backup schedule of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday:
On what day would you schedule a level 0 backup to be done?
Monday
In what order should the backups be applied to restore a system that was completely lost after an attack?
Start with Monday, end with Friday.
What command do you use to create a level 0 backup of archive/home/user1?
tar cvvWf backup.tar --listed-incremental=backup.snar --level 0 archive/home/user1
What command would you use to list the contents of an incremental backup?
tar tvvf backup.tar --incremental
After listing the contents of an incremental backup, what do the following letters indicate:
Y indicates that the file is contained in the backup.tar archive.
N indicates that the file was present in the directory at the time the archive was made, but was not added to the backup.tar archive because it has not changed since the last backup.
D indicates the file is a directory.
