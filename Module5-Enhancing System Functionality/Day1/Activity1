Activity File: Creating and Restoring Backups with tar
Part 1: Creating Backups with tar
In this two-part activity, you are a junior administrator at Rezifp Pharma Inc.
The company conducts clinical trials on drugs for oncology, immunology, and vaccines. In recent weeks, there have been a series of malware attacks. The company is now strengthening its backup activities.
In response to the malware attacks, your department has decided to create daily full backups of the files associated with the E-Prescription Treatment database, which is the main system for many departments.
You have been tasked with:
Creating a name for the tar archive using the department's standard naming convention.
Creating daily full backups of the directories and files in the ~/Documents/epscript directory.
Printing the file permission, owner, size, date, and time for each file in the archive.
Verifying the archive after it is written to check for errors.
Creating a file containing the output of the tar command for later review by the SysOps team, which will check file structure, permissions, and errors.
Lab Environment
To complete the activity, log into this Moduleâ€™s lab environment using the following credentials:
Username: sysadmin
Password: cybersecurity
Instructions
Move to the ~/Documents/epscript directory.
List the epscript directory contents and answer the following question:
What directories and files are located there?
Standardize the file name for your backup:
Your department uses the ISO 8601 standard for representing the date in the naming convention for all archives.
Using the standard for representing the date, YYYY-MM-DD, allows sysadmins to locate an archive quickly.
Use the date May 5, 2019 and convert it to the ISO 8601 format without dashes.
Add the filename epscript.tar to the end of the ISO 8601 date.
What will be the archive name?
Write a tar command that creates an archive with the following characteristics:
Recall that [ISO_8601_date]epscript.tar is the archive file name.
The file backup will include the epscript directory and includes all directories and files contained within it.
File permission, owner, size, and date and time information are recorded for each file in the archive.
The archive is verified after writing it, in order to validate the integrity of the data.
Hint: This is a new option. See the man page.
The output from the tar command is written to the file [archive_name].txt for later review by the SysOps team to check file structure, permissions, and errors.
Note: archive_name is the tar archive name you created using [ISO_8601_date]epscript.tar.
Using the less command, review the output of the .txt file.
What is displayed in the output file?
Part 2: Restoring Backups with tar
The E-Prescription Treatment database was attacked and taken offline.
Fortunately, the team had a recent full backup and was able to recover the database, making the system operational. However, a pharmacy technician noticed that some files in the patient database were missing, and the team discovered that the wrong full backup was used. The system was taken offline again.
It is critical that the missing patient files are restored as soon as possible. You have spoken to the pharmacy technician and received a list of the names of patients whose files are missing.
You have been tasked with:
Listing the contents of an archive to determine what it contains.
Creating a directory to restore the patient data for review.
Extracting only the patient files to the directory so they can be checked by the pharmacy technician.
Instructions
Move to the ~/Documents/epscript/backup directory.
List the contents of the directory to display the 20190814epscript.tar file. You will search this archive for the missing patient data.
Extract the patient directory from the 20190814epscript.tar archive.
Extract patient data to the patient_search directory in the ~/Documents/epscript/backup directory.
Test for any errors when extracting. This will check the integrity of the archive.
List the contents of the patient_search directory to check that the patient directory and files were extracted there.
Bonus
View the specific patient directory and file information contained within the archive.
Use grep to find the following two patients' file information located in the archive:
Mark Lopez
Megan Patel



Solution Guide: Creating and Restoring Backups with tar
The goal of this activity was to create a full backup of the epscript directories and files, including file permissions, owner, size of file, and date and time information. Students verified the archive for errors after writing it and the output from the command was saved to a text file. In the second part of the activity, they located the correct archive to restore the patient directory and files.
Completing this activity required the following steps:
Creating the name of the tar archive using the YYYMMDD ISO 8601 standard.
Creating a full backup using the tar create option.
Printing the full listing for each file, including the name, file permissions, and owner information.
Verifying the archive after it was written to check for errors.
Creating a file of the output of the tar command for later review by the SysOps team.
Listing the contents of the archive to determine what it contains.
Creating a directory to restore the patient directories and files.
Extracting only the patient directory and files to the directory for review before restoring the files to the E-Prescription Treatment system.
Bonus: Using the grep command to search the archive for two patient names.
Completing these steps will ensure that our archive has the correct data and no errors, and can be used in the event of a malware attack to restore the E-Prescription Treatment system.
Part 1 Walkthrough
First, we move to the ~/Documents/epscript directory.
cd ~/Documents/epscript/
List the directories and files located there:
Run ls -l.
Output should look similar to the following:

drwxr-xr-x  2   sysadmin  sysadmin  4096    Jul 16   14:02   doctors
drwxr-xr-x  2   sysadmin  sysadmin  4096    Jul 16   14:02   patients
drwxr-xr-x  2   sysadmin  sysadmin  4096    Jul 16   14:00   treatments
Here, we see three directories: doctors, patients, and treatments.
Run ls -l epscript/doctors/ to list the contents of the doctor directory and display the contents, which are .csv files.
Output should read:

-rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:16   doctor10.csv
-rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:12   doctor1.csv
-rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:13   doctor2.csv
-rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:15   doctor3.csv
-rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:15   doctor4.csv
-rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:15   doctor5.csv
-rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:15   doctor6.csv
-rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:15   doctor7.csv
-rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:16   doctor8.csv
-rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   14:16   doctor9.csv
-rw-r--r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  75962   Jul 16   13:22   doctor.csv
List the contents of the patient and treatment directories and display the contents of the other .csv files.
Run ls -l epscript/patients/.
Run ls -l epscript/treatments/.
The archive filename is created using the ISO 8601 standard.
Using the standard format of [YYYMMDD][filename].tar, our archive filename is: 20190505epscript.tar.
ISO stands for International Organization for Standards. It publishes international standards such as the ISO/IEC 27032:2012 which is a standard for internet security issues.
Emphasize that ISO 8601 for filenames is important because:
The naming convention is recognized internationally.
Files prefixed with an ISO date will automatically sort oldest to newest under the default alphabetical sort.
Write a tar command that creates an archive with the following characteristics:
The syntax is tar [option(s)] [archive_filename] [objects_to_archive].
The command is tar cvvWf 20190505epscript.tar epscript/ > 20190505epscript.txt.
Syntax breakdown:
tar is the name of the command.
c creates the archive.
vv, very verbose, or verbosity level 2 prints the full file specification for each file in the archive.
W verifies the archive after writing it.
f specifies the filename for our archive.
20190505epscript.tar: is the archive filename that we created following the ISO 8601 guidelines.
epscript/* is the directory that contains all of the files to archive. We use the asterisk * wildcard to denote that we want everything in this directory and all of its subdirectories.
> 20190505epscript.txt saves the output of the command to the 20190505epscript.txt text file.
Using the less command, review the output of the 20190505epscript.txt file:
Run less 20190505epscript.txt.
Output should look similar to the following snippet:

drwxr-xr-x  sysadmin/sysadmin   0       2019-07-16  15:11   epscript
drwxr-xr-x  sysadmin/sysadmin   0       2019-07-16  15:24   epscript/treatment
-rw-r--r--  sysadmin/sysadmin   192273  2019-07-16  15:24   epscript/treatment/treatments10.csv

Note: Notice that the entire directory structure remains intact as compared to the original directory structure.
Part 2 Walkthrough
Move to and list the contents of the ~/Documents/epscript/backup directory.
Run cd ~/Documents/epscript/backup.
Run ls -l.
Your output should look similar to this:

-rw--r-r--  1   sysadmin  sysadmin  4341760    Jul 17   01:45   20190814epscript.tar
We'll use the 20190814epscript.tar file to search for the patient information.
List the contents of the 20190814epscript.tar and pipe the output to the screen.
Run tar tvvf 20190814epscript.tar | less.
Output should look similar to the following:

drwxr-xr-x  sysadmin/sysadmin   0       2019-07-16  15:11   epscript
drwxr-xr-x  sysadmin/sysadmin   0       2019-07-16  15:24   epscript/treatment
-rw-r--r--  sysadmin/sysadmin   192273  2019-07-16  15:24   epscript/treatment/treatments10.csv
Extract the patient files from the archive, test for errors, and save them in the patient_search directory.
The general syntax of the command is tar [options][archive_name][option][option][save_directory][objects_to_archive].
In the ~/Documents/epscript/backup directory, make a new directory called patient_search.
Run sudo mkdir patient_search.
Run sudo tar xvvf 20190814epscript.tar -C patient_search/ epscript/patients.
Syntax breakdown:
xvvf refers to the options.
20190814epscript.tar is the archive name.
-C saves the indicated patient directory and its files.
patient_search/ is the indicated directory.
epscript/patients is the directory that contains the patient files. We are extracting files from this directory in the tar archive.
Verify that the patient files were extracted to the patient_search directory:
Run ls -l patient_search/epscript/patients.
Your output should look similar to this:
-rw-r--r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin  12193 Aug 14  2019 patients.10.csv
-rw-r--r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin  12334 Aug 14  2019 patients.1.csv
-rw-r--r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin  12534 Aug 14  2019 patients.2.csv
-rw-r--r-- 1 sysadmin sysadmin  12398 Aug 14  2019 patients.3.csv
Bonus
This step would normally precede Step 3.
Use grep to find the file information of two patients, Mark Lopez and Megan Patel, located in the archive.
Note: It is generally best practice to look inside the archive, prior to restoring data, in order to ensure that the files you are looking for are actually there. This step would usually precede Step 3.
Perform a search within the ~/Documents/epscript directory for Mark Lopez patient records:
Move into the directory cd ~/Documents/epscript.
Ensure archive has been extracted for viewing tar xvf 20190814epscript.tar.
Search grep -R "Mark,Lopez" epscript/.
Or run grep -R 'Mark,Lopez' patient_research/
The output should look similar to the following:

809,Mark,Lopez,male,O,31,577.511.1054x23935,jeffrey93@jones.net,model,"673 Schultz Spur Apt. 244
809,Mark,Lopez,male,O,31,577.511.1054x23935,jeffrey93@jones.net,model,"673 Schultz Spur Apt. 244

Within the same directory, perform a search for Megan Patel patient records as follows:
Run grep -R "Megan,Patel" epscript/.
Or run grep -R 'Megan,Patel' patient_research/
The output should look similar to the following:

699,Megan,Patel,female,AB,43,001-684-391-7956,pjohnson@gmail.com,develop,"53082 Lopez IslandChavezchester, CT 11475"
699,Megan,Patel,female,AB,43,001-684-391-7956,pjohnson@gmail.com,develop,"53082 Lopez Island
