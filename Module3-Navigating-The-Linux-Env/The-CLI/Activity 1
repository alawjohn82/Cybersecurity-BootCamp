Module 3 Day 3 Activity File: find Your Way

In this activity, you will continue in your role as a security analyst at Candy Corp.
Your manager has identified why PeanutButtery.net was targeted: Henry had hidden a secret recipe for a revolutionary candy within the file system, and Sugar Corp was trying to find it.
Your manager at Candy Corp needs you to search through the files and file directories of the PeanutButtery.net server to find the hidden recipes in its file system.
You are tasked with scanning the directories of the PeanutButtery.net site to uncover the secret recipes hidden by Henry.

Instructions

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks in the /03-student/day2/finding_your_way/ folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:
Navigate into the PeanutButtery.net directory.
1- Find all directories that have the word "secret" in their directory name.
2- Find all files that have the word "recipe" in their file name.

Bonus
Your manager believes the recipe is for peanut candy and would like you to narrow your search to include only those recipes.
Use a single command to find all the files that have the words "recipe" and "peanut" in their name.
Hint: Research how to use the AND functionality with the find command.
