Module 3 Day 3 Activity File: Warm-up

You are a security analyst at Candy Corp. Thanks to your work so far, Candy Corp's management was able to apprehend Ruth and Henry.
The local authorities have video evidence that Sugar Corp delivered a cash payment to Candy Corp's back door on October 13, 2019.
You are tasked with gathering physical access logs to prove Henry or Ruth opened the back door for the delivery. This will help the authorities solidify their case.


Instructions
Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from within the /03-student/day2/warmup/ folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:
1- Make a directory in the warmup folder, called additional_evidence.
2- Navigate to the directory that contains the physical_access_logs directory.
3- Using preview commands, identify the physical access logs that contain files for October 13, 2019.
4- Combine these files into a single file, called Physical_Access_evidence.
5- Move this new file to the additional_evidence folder.

Solution Guide: Warm-up
The first step is to navigate into the /03-student/day2/warmup/ folder on our virtual machines. To do this, run the following command:
cd /03-student/day2/warmup/
Next, confirm which directories are in this folder by running ls. This will display the following three directories:
physical_access_logs/
server_logs/
web_logs/
The next step is to create a directory called additional_evidence. Run the following command:
mkdir additional_evidence
We have been tasked with viewing the physical_access_logs. To navigate into this directory, run the following:
cd physical_access_logs/
This folder contains six physical access logs. To view the contents, run preview commands (head, more, or less) to find out which contain the data for October 13, 2019. For example, you could run the following:
head physical1
After viewing all the files, we determine that the two files containing logs for that date are physical4 and physical5. We need to combine these two files into a single file called Physical_Access_evidence.
To do this, run the cat command:
cat physical4 physical5 > Physical_Access_evidence
We can run the ls command again to show that the file has been created.
Lastly, we need to move this new file to the additional_evidence folder. We do this using absolute paths:
mv /03-student/day2/warmup/physical_access_logs/Physical_Access_evidence /03-student/day2/warmup/additional_evidence
