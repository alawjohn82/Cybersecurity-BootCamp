Module 3 Day 3 Activity File: Warm-up

You are a security analyst at Candy Corp. Thanks to your work so far, Candy Corp's management was able to apprehend Ruth and Henry.
The local authorities have video evidence that Sugar Corp delivered a cash payment to Candy Corp's back door on October 13, 2019.
You are tasked with gathering physical access logs to prove Henry or Ruth opened the back door for the delivery. This will help the authorities solidify their case.


Instructions
Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from within the /03-student/day2/warmup/ folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:
1- Make a directory in the warmup folder, called additional_evidence.
2- Navigate to the directory that contains the physical_access_logs directory.
3- Using preview commands, identify the physical access logs that contain files for October 13, 2019.
4- Combine these files into a single file, called Physical_Access_evidence.
5- Move this new file to the additional_evidence folder.

Answer:

1. Navigate to the warmup folder:

cd /03-student/day2/warmup/
2. Make a directory called additional_evidence:

mkdir additional_evidence
3. Navigate to the directory that contains the physical_access_logs directory:
Assuming the physical_access_logs directory is somewhere inside the warmup directory, find it by navigating through the folders:


cd /path/to/physical_access_logs
(Replace /path/to/ with the actual path to the physical_access_logs directory.)

4. Preview the physical access logs for October 13, 2019:
You can use the grep command to search for files that contain "October 13, 2019". Assuming the logs are text files, run:

grep -l "October 13, 2019" *.log
This will list all the log files that contain records for October 13, 2019.

5. Combine the identified log files into a single file:
Once you've identified the log files, use the cat command to concatenate them into a single file called Physical_Access_evidence:


cat file1.log file2.log file3.log > Physical_Access_evidence
(Replace file1.log, file2.log, and file3.log with the actual log file names from October 13, 2019.)

6. Move the Physical_Access_evidence file to the additional_evidence folder:
Now, move the combined file to the additional_evidence folder:


mv Physical_Access_evidence /03-student/day2/warmup/additional_evidence/
7. Verify the contents of the additional_evidence folder:
To ensure that the file has been moved successfully, navigate back to the additional_evidence folder and list its contents:

cd /03-student/day2/warmup/additional_evidence/
ls -l
Summary of Commands:

cd /03-student/day2/warmup/
mkdir additional_evidence
cd /path/to/physical_access_logs
grep -l "October 13, 2019" *.log
cat file1.log file2.log file3.log > Physical_Access_evidence
mv Physical_Access_evidence /03-student/day2/warmup/additional_evidence/
cd /03-student/day2/warmup/additional_evidence/
ls -l
This sequence will combine the physical access logs from October 13, 2019, into a single file and move it to the additional_evidence folder.
