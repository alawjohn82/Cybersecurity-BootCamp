Module 3 Day 3 Activity File: grep

You will continue in your role as a security analyst at Candy Corp.
Your manager now needs to know which of the secret recipes include guavaberries.
Even if Sugar Corp was able to obtain the secret recipe, they won't be able to produce the candy, since Candy is the sole owner of the guavaberry plant.
Your task is to determine which of the secret recipes contain guavaberries in the list of ingredients.

Instructions
Using only the command line, continue to complete the following tasks in the /03-student/day2/finding_your_way/ folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:
1- Navigate back into the PeanutButtery.net directory that contained the secret recipes.
Hint: Remember, by default grep does not search subdirectories, so make sure you are in the directory with the secret recipes.
Bonus: Search the man page for grep to find a way to search subdirectories.
2- Find all recipes that include the word "guavaberries" in their list of ingredients.

Bonus

Your manager realizes that some of the recipes require guavaberries as optional, and is now concerned Sugar Corp can still make these secret recipes.
Compose a single command to find all the files that have the word "guavaberries" OR "optional" in the recipe.

Answer:

1. Navigate to the PeanutButtery.net directory (if not already there):

cd /03-student/day2/finding_your_way/PeanutButtery.net/
2. Find files with both "recipe" and "peanut" in their name:
Use the find command with a wildcard pattern that includes both "recipe" and "peanut":

find . -type f -name "*recipe*peanut*"
This command will:

Search the current directory (.) and its subdirectories.
Only look for files (-type f).
Match file names that contain both "recipe" and "peanut" (-name "*recipe*peanut*"), in any order but within the same file name.
3. Summary of Commands:

cd /03-student/day2/finding_your_way/PeanutButtery.net/
find . -type f -name "*recipe*peanut*"
This will locate all files that have both "recipe" and "peanut" in their name within the PeanutButtery.net directory.

BONUS:

1. Navigate to the PeanutButtery.net directory (if not already there):

cd /03-student/day2/finding_your_way/PeanutButtery.net/
2. Search for files containing "guavaberries" or "optional":
Use the following grep command:

grep -rE "guavaberries|optional" *
This command will:

Use grep to search for patterns inside files.
-r enables recursive search, meaning it will search through all files and subdirectories.
-E allows you to use extended regular expressions, which supports the use of the | (OR) operator.
"guavaberries|optional" specifies the two words you're looking for, separated by the OR operator (|).
* specifies to search all files.
3. Summary of Commands:

cd /03-student/day2/finding_your_way/PeanutButtery.net/
grep -rE "guavaberries|optional" *
This will search for any files within the directory that contain either the word "guavaberries" or "optional" in their content.
