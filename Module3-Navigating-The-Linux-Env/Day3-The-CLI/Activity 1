Module 3 Day 3 Activity File: find Your Way

In this activity, you will continue in your role as a security analyst at Candy Corp.
Your manager has identified why PeanutButtery.net was targeted: Henry had hidden a secret recipe for a revolutionary candy within the file system, and Sugar Corp was trying to find it.
Your manager at Candy Corp needs you to search through the files and file directories of the PeanutButtery.net server to find the hidden recipes in its file system.
You are tasked with scanning the directories of the PeanutButtery.net site to uncover the secret recipes hidden by Henry.

Instructions

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks in the /03-student/day2/finding_your_way/ folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:
Navigate into the PeanutButtery.net directory.
1- Find all directories that have the word "secret" in their directory name.
2- Find all files that have the word "recipe" in their file name.

Bonus
Your manager believes the recipe is for peanut candy and would like you to narrow your search to include only those recipes.
Use a single command to find all the files that have the words "recipe" and "peanut" in their name.
Hint: Research how to use the AND functionality with the find command.



Solution Guide: find Your Way
The first step is to navigate into the /03-student/day2/finding_your_way/PeanutButtery.net/ folder on your virtual machine. To complete this step, run the following command:
cd /03-student/day2/finding_your_way/PeanutButtery.net/
The next step is to find all directories that have the word "secret" in their name. To do this, run:
find -type d -iname *secret*
Note the syntax:
find is the command-line command.
-type is the option for specifying whether you're searching for a file or a directory/
d is the required parameter for the -type option, indicating that you're searching for a directory.
-iname is the option indicating that you're searching for a specific case-insensitive value.
*secret* is the parameter indicating the value you're searching for. The two wildcards indicate that the value secret can be located anywhere in the file name.
When you run the command, the results should return the following directory path, containing the value of secret: ./other/disregard/candysecretrecipes.
This means the directory candysecretrecipes is within the disregard directory, within the other directory.
Next, we need to find the files that contain the word "recipe." The command is:
find -type f -iname *recipe*
Note the syntax:
find is the command-line command.
-type is the option for specifying whether you're searching for a file or directory.
f is the required parameter for the -type option, indicating that you're searching for a file.
-iname is the option indicating that you're searching for a specific case-insensitive value.
*recipe* is the parameter specifying the value you're searching for. The two wildcards indicate that the value recipe can be located anywhere in the file name.
The results of the command should return the following four files that have the value of recipe in the name:
./other/disregard/candysecretrecipes/recipe_crunchybars
./other/disregard/candysecretrecipes/recipe_peanutballs
./other/disregard/candysecretrecipes/recipe_peanutsquares
./other/disregard/candysecretrecipes/recipe_yumbars
The four files are recipe_yumbars, recipe_peanutsquares, recipe_peanutballs, and recipe_crunchybars.
Bonus
You are asked to find files containing the words "recipe" and "peanut" in the name.
To do this, use a conditional of -a to add an additional search. The command is as follows:
find -type f -iname *recipe* -a -iname *peanut*
Note the syntax:
find is the command-line command.
-type is the option for specifying whether you're searching for a file or directory.
f is the required parameter for the -type option, indicating that you're searching for a file.
-iname is the option indicating that you're searching for a specific case-insensitive value.
*recipe* is the parameter specifying the value you're searching for. The two wildcards indicate that the value of recipe can be located anywhere in the file name.
-a is the conditional statement that represents AND, which states that the next value must also be matched in the result.
-o can be used as an OR conditional, returning results that include either one of the specified values.
-iname *peanut* is the second value that needs to be found in a file name.
When you run the command, the results show that the following two files that have the words "recipe" and "peanut" in their name:
./other/disregard/candysecretrecipes/recipe_peanutballs
./other/disregard/candysecretrecipes/recipe_peanutsquares
