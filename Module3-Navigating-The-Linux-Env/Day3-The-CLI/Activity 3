Module 3 Day 3 Activity File: Gather Evidence

In this activity, you will continue in your role as a security analyst at Candy Corp.
Candy Corp believes it has enough evidence to send to the authorities to charge Sugar Corp with a cyber crime.
Your task is to gather several points of evidence from your file systems that can be provided to the authorities to prove Sugar is stealing data.

Instructions

Using only the command line, continue to complete the following tasks in the /03-student/day2/Gathering_Evidence folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:
1- In the Gathering_Evidence folder, make a directory called Sugar_evidence.
2- The email directory contains an archive of emails from the employees.
    Place the following data in a new file, called sugar_email_evidence:
    A list of emails referencing Sugar
    The number of emails referencing Sugar
    Hint: Use the pipe and redirection command to append the additional data to this file.
3- The web_logs directory contains an archive of web log access by date for PeanutButtery.net. The IP of Sugar, which is a numerical number that identifies an address on the network, is 13.16.23.234.
Place the following data in a new file, called sugar_web_evidence:
The web log data that contains the IP address of Sugar
The number of times Sugar's IP is found in this file
4- Move the two new evidence files into the directory, Sugar_evidence.
5- Combine them both into a single file, called Sugar_evidence_for_authorities.


Solution Guide: Gather Evidence
The first step is to navigate into the /03-student/day2/Gathering_Evidence/ folder on our virtual machines. To do this, run the following command:
cd /03-student/day2/Gathering_Evidence/
In the Gathering_Evidence folder, make a directory called Sugar_evidence by running the following:
mkdir Sugar_evidence
Next, move into the email directory:
cd email
List the emails referencing Sugar, and place the results in a file called Sugar_email_evidence:
grep -il sugar * > sugar_email_evidence
Next, add the number of emails that contain Sugar to the same file:
grep -il sugar * | wc -l >> sugar_email_evidence
The next step is to place the following data into a new file, called sugar_web_evidence:
The web log file that contains Sugar's IP address
The number of Sugar IPs addresses found in this file
Access the web_logs directory by going back a directory (cd ..), then by running the following:
cd web_logs
To find the log files that have the IP address of 13.16.23.234 and place them in a new file called sugar_web_evidence, run the following:
grep -il 13.16.23.234 * > sugar_web_evidence
Next, to append the number of records that contain the IP address to this file, run the following:
grep -i 13.16.23.234 * | wc -l >> sugar_web_evidence
Now, move both evidence files to the Sugar_evidence directory that we created:
cd ../../
mv ./Gathering_Evidence/email/sugar_email_evidence ./Gathering_Evidence/Sugar_evidence/
mv ./Gathering_Evidence/web_logs/sugar_web_evidence ./Gathering_Evidence/Sugar_evidence/
Next, navigate to the Sugar_evidence directory, and concatenate the files into a single file called Sugar_evidence_for_authorities:
cd Gathering_Evidence/Sugar_evidence/
cat sugar_email_evidence sugar_web_evidence > Sugar_evidence_for_authorities
The last step is to confirm that the file has the correct data for the authorities. Run the following command:
cat Sugar_evidence_for_authorities
The results should be as follows:

email5 
email7  
email8  
3
0518weblog 
22
While this file contains all the data the authorities need, this is not obvious. In the next lesson, we will learn how to edit the contents of a file to further describe the evidence.
