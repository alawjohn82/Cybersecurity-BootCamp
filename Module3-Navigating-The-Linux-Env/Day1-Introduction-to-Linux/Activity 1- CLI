Module 3 Day 1 Activity File: Take Five and Practice the Command Line

You are playing the role of a security analyst at Candy Corp.
Candy Corp believes one of its employees may be selling secret recipes to Sugar Corp.
You have been tasked with creating evidence files for email, logs, and web access.
These files are currently empty, but will be used later to organize your investigation notes on the rogue employee.

Instructions

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from within the /03-student/day1/take_5/ folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:
1- Create a folder called Internal_Investigation_Employee_A.
2- Navigate into the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder.
3- From within the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder, print the working directory to confirm you are in the correct place.
4- Create the following three files inside the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder:
    email_evidence
    log_evidence
    web_evidence
5- Delete the file called web_evidence, as you have realized Candy has no web logs captured.
6- Display (list) all the files created.
7- Clear the terminal window.

Answer:

1. Create a folder called Internal_Investigation_Employee_A:

mkdir Internal_Investigation_Employee_A
2. Navigate into the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder:

cd Internal_Investigation_Employee_A
3. Print the working directory to confirm you are in the correct place:

pwd
This should output the path, confirming you are inside the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder.

4. Create the files email_evidence, log_evidence, and web_evidence:

touch email_evidence log_evidence web_evidence

5. Delete the file web_evidence:

rm web_evidence

6. Display (list) all the files created:

ls
This should list the remaining files: email_evidence and log_evidence.
