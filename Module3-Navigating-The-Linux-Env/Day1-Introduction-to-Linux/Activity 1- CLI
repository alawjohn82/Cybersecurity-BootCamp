Module 3 Day 1 Activity File: Take Five and Practice the Command Line

You are playing the role of a security analyst at Candy Corp.
Candy Corp believes one of its employees may be selling secret recipes to Sugar Corp.
You have been tasked with creating evidence files for email, logs, and web access.
These files are currently empty, but will be used later to organize your investigation notes on the rogue employee.

Instructions

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from within the /03-student/day1/take_5/ folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:
1- Create a folder called Internal_Investigation_Employee_A.
2- Navigate into the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder.
3- From within the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder, print the working directory to confirm you are in the correct place.
4- Create the following three files inside the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder:
    email_evidence
    log_evidence
    web_evidence
5- Delete the file called web_evidence, as you have realized Candy has no web logs captured.
6- Display (list) all the files created.
7- Clear the terminal window.

Solution Guide: Take Five and Practice the Command Line

1- First, navigate into the /03-student/day1/take_5 folder on your virtual machine. To do so, run the following commands:
cd /03-student/day1/
cd take_5
Create a folder called Internal_Investigation_Employee_A:
mkdir Internal_Investigation_Employee_A
Confirm that the folder was created:
ls
2- Navigate into Internal_Investigation_Employee_A:
cd Internal_Investigation_Employee_A
3- From within the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder, print the working directory to confirm that you are in the correct location:
pwd
This should display:

 /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A
4- Create three files inside the Internal_Investigation_Employee_A folder: email_evidence, log_evidence, and web_evidence:
touch email_evidence log_evidence web_evidence
We created three files with one command by putting a space between each of the file names, but we could also create them one at a time.
5- Delete the file called web_evidence:
rm web_evidence
6- Display (list) all the files created:
ls
The two files that display are as follows:

email_evidence 
log_evidence
7- Lastly, clear the terminal window:
clear
