Module 3 Day 1 Activity File: Find your Milky Way

You will continue in your role as security analyst at Candy Corp, investigating the employee potentially selling secret recipes to Sugar Corp.
Your manager at Candy Corp needs you to create an additional directory, as they believe there is a second employee working with Sugar Corp.
You must also copy and move several of the evidence files after creating this new directory.

Instructions

Using only the command line, continue to complete the following tasks in the /03-student/day1/take_5 folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:
1- Create an additional folder called Internal_Investigation_Employee_B.
2- Using absolute paths, move the file email_evidence from Internal_Investigation_Employee_A to Internal_Investigation_Employee_B because you have been told there wonâ€™t be email evidence for the first employee.
3- Using absolute paths, copy the file log_evidence from Internal_Investigation_Employee_A to Internal_Investigation_Employee_B, as you have been told there will likely be log evidence from both employees.
4- Check your directories to confirm the files are all in the correct locations.

Answer:

1. Create a folder called Internal_Investigation_Employee_B:

mkdir /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_B

2. Move the file email_evidence from Internal_Investigation_Employee_A to Internal_Investigation_Employee_B using absolute paths:

mv /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A/email_evidence /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_B/

3. Copy the file log_evidence from Internal_Investigation_Employee_A to Internal_Investigation_Employee_B using absolute paths:

cp /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A/log_evidence /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_B/

4. Check your directories to confirm the files are all in the correct locations:
To check the contents of Internal_Investigation_Employee_A:

ls /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A
Expected output should show only log_evidence:

log_evidence
To check the contents of Internal_Investigation_Employee_B:

ls /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_B
Expected output should show both email_evidence and log_evidence:

email_evidence
log_evidence

This will confirm that the files are in their correct locations after the move and copy operations.
