Module 3 Day 2 Activity File: Oh Henry, What Did You Do?


You are continuing in your role as a security analyst at Candy Corp, investigating the employees potentially selling secret recipes to Sugar Corp.
Your manager at Candy Corp has identified two possible insiders who may be working with Sugar Corp: Henry and Ruth.
Your manager pulled some files from Henry and Ruth's computers without their knowledge.
Some of the files contain gibberish, but some may have useful data.
Your manager has asked you to preview the files to see whether they have readable text data that can be analyzed later.

Instructions

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from the /03-student/day1/oh_henry/ folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:
1- There are two folders inside the /03-student/day1/oh_henry/ folder: One for files captured from Henry and one for files captured from Ruth.
Use the preview commands to determine which of the files contain readable text data.
2- Remove the files that contain non-readable text data.

Bonus
The files each have a timestamp at the bottom.
Use the mv command to rename each file by adding the date found on the bottom of the file.
For example, File1 has a date of October 11, 2019. Rename it to file1-10_11_2019.


Solution Guide: Oh Henry, What Did You Do?
The first step is to navigate into the students/oh_henry folder on your virtual machine. To do so, run the following command:
cd /03-student/day1
Navigate to Henry's folder:
cd henry
There are many files in this directory. You can preview each file by using head, more, or less. For example, you could use either of the following:
head do.txt
more do.txt
Most of the files contain non-ASCII data, as they are actually image files.
The three files in each folder that contain text data are the following:
In Henry’s folder: do.txt; sp.txt; and wp.txt
In Ruth’s: l8.txt; hy.txt; and ud.txt
Delete the other files:
rm dj.txt bb.txt b7.txt sd.txt ta.txt
Confirm that only the correct files remain in Henry's folder by running the command: ls
The files that should remain are do.txt; sp.txt, and wp.txt.
Complete this same process in Ruth's folder.
The files that should remain are l8.txt; hy.txt, and ud.txt.
Bonus
To view the date on the bottom of each file, run:
tail do.txt
On the bottom of the file, called do.txt, is the date October 13, 2019. To rename this file, run:
mv do.txt do.txt_10_13_2019
Follow this same process for all the files.
The final results for Henry should be as follows:
do.txt_10_13_2019
sp.txt_10_14_2019
wp.txt_10_15_2019
The final results for Ruth should be as follows:
l8.txt_10_13_2019
hy.txt_10_14_2019
ud.txt_10_15_2019
