Activity File: Network Addressing
In this activity, you will continue to play the role of a security analyst at Acme Corp.
Your security manager identifies the potential hacker that works at Acme Corp. Your manager is also capturing the potential hacker's traffic. They believe the hacker is accessing secret internal resources.
While your security manager is able to capture the server IP address the hacker is accessing, they are only able to capture the raw binary traffic.
Your task is to convert the binary traffic into an IP address, determine if it is a public or private address, and compare the IP to a list of Acme's servers to see which system the hacker is attempting to access.

Instructions
Convert the following binary representations into numeric IP addresses:
11000000101010000100010110010001
00001010000000000000000000101010
11000000101011000100010110010001
00101001001011011011011000100000
00001010000000000000000001001100
Determine whether the numeric IP addresses are public or private.
Compare the numeric IP addresses to the Acme server list and determine to which server the IPs belong.
Summarize your findings to determine what resources the hacker is trying to access.
Bonus
Your security manager also finds the following binary data in the hacker's logs:
100010001111011111000111011001010001101000110110
Determine what this binary data represents.
Hint: This may translate to an IP address, but it is not actually an IP address.
