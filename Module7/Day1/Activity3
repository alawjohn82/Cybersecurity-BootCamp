In the previous activity, you used the net command-line tool to find various types of information.
Your CIO noticed the previous password policies were not very strict and wants to enforce new password policies on this Windows workstation for the next two new users: senior developer Andrew and sales representative Bob.


You are tasked with creating a regular user, Bob, and an administrative user, Andrew, and setting the password policies with the following parameters:


Maximum password age is 90 days.


Minimum password length is 12 characters.


Password complexity requirements are enabled.


Continue using the Windows RDP host machine.
Instructions:
Create a regular user, Bob, using the net user command-line tool.


Set the user's password to Ilovesales123!. They will change this on their first day.


Note that you can use net user [username] * to change the password of an existing user (if you added the user without setting the password, or set it improperly).
Create a user, Andrew, and add them to the Administrators group.


Set the user's password to Ilovedevelopment123!. They will change this on their first day.


Use net to verify that Andrew is in the Administrators group.


Launch gpedit and set the following password policies for the entire Windows machine:
