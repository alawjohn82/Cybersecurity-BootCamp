Activity File: Generating Windows Event Log Files with Parameters and Pipelines
In this activity, you will play the role of a Windows system administrator.
You are tasked with creating and saving logs to the directory C:\Logs.


These logs can then be sent to security analysts for examination in a Security Information and Event Management System (SIEM).


Continue to use the Windows RDP host machine for this activity.
Instructions
Your CIO has asked you to do the following in PowerShell:
Use Get-WinEvent -listlog * to show the list of available logs.


Check for, and retrieve, the names of the security and application logs.


For each of these logs, create a pipeline that:


Gets the latest 100 events.


Transforms the log to JSON.


Outputs the objects in the JSON file to the C:\Logs directory.


Hint: To complete this activity, you will need to use the Get-WinEvent, ConvertTo-Json, and Out-File cmdlets.
At the end of this activity, the following files should be in C:\Logs:


RecentSecurityLogs.json
RecentApplicationLogs.json
This means you'll need to run the PowerShell pipeline at least two times.


Solution Guide: Generating Windows Event Log Files with Parameters and Pipelines
In this activity, you were responsible for retrieving recent security and application logs using PowerShell, transforming them to JSON, and then saving them to C:\Logs.
Solutions
First, we need to check the names of the logs we want to retrieve:


Run Get-WinEvent -listlog * to show all log names.
Check for, and retrieve, the names of the security and application logs:


Scroll to the top to show the Security and Application log names in the LogName column.


Note the column header LogName. This header is also the parameter we need.


Let's add parameters to our cmdlet to retrieve security logs:


Run Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -MaxEvents 100 to show only 100 events.


Add the ConvertTo-Json cmdlet to convert the output to JSON format:


Run Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -MaxEvents 100 | ConvertTo-Json
Pipe that output to a file:


Run Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -MaxEvents 100 | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File -FilePath "C:\Logs\RecentSecurityLogs.json"
Since we didn't see any confirmation output, let's check the contents of the logs:


Run Get-Content C:\Logs\RecentSecurityLogs.json to confirm the logs were created.

 To get the latest 100 events from the application logs, run:


Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -MaxEvents 100 | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File -FilePath "C:\Logs\RecentApplicationLogs.json"
