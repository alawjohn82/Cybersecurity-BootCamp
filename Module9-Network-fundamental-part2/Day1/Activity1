Module 9 Day 1
Activity File: DHCP Attacks
In this activity, you will play the role of a security analyst at Acme Corp.
Acme Corp employees are currently experiencing network access issues and are unable to connect to the internet.
These employees are receiving error messages saying no local IP addresses are available, indicating a potential issue with DHCP.
Acme believes an internal attack may have occurred and would like you to investigate by analyzing a packet capture to determine what type of attack may be causing the issue.
Instructions
Open the provided packet capture with Wireshark.
DHCPActivity.pcap
Create a filter to determine the count for each DHCP activity:
DHCP Discover
DHCP Offer
DHCP Request
Based on these results, summarize what type of attack may have occurred, and why you believe Acme Corp employees are having network issues.
Bonus
Analyze the source MAC addresses of the DHCP activities and summarize what the attacker is doing.
